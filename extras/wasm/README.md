# EXPERIMENTAL

The content in this directory should not be considered stable.

It has no defined API and its use is not currently supported.

As of writing, it requires nightly Rust.

It's pretty neat though! askalono can run in a web browser! This presents some
interesting use cases:

* In-browser license identification/diffing tools
* Firefox/Chrome/WebExtension utility to ID licenses
* Easy Node.js integration without the need for a compiler toolchain

The excitement is real.
